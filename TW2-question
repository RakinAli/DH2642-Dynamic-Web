Two questions we still wonder about

1.	What is the priority of properties in CSS?
	For example we didn't get align-items to work as we wished
	and we assume it is because of some other property being prioritized.

2.	<div class="firstClass">
		<div class="secondClass"></div>
	</div>

	Will the CSS properties of the first class overwrite the ones of the second class,
	or is it the other way around? How does the hierarchy work?

Two questions we know the answer to

1.	What does useEffect() do?

	You pass a function, to useEffect(), which is to be called after each render.
	This way you make it possible for each render to have side effects.

2.	What does .fetch(), .then() and.catch() do respectively?

	.fetch() makes a request to an API and if the request if fulfilled it returns a promise and
	.then() is executed. If any promise of the chain is not fulfilled then .catch() is executed.
