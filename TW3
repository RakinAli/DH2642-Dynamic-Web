Two questions we still wonder about

1.	How would you create a UI that keeps in sync for a device user
	but doesn't interfere with the data stored for different device users?

2.	When do you use Firebase over MongoDB and vice versa?

Two questions we know the answer to

1.	What does setTimeout(function, 0) do?

	The function will have another flow of execution. This is why
	the loadingFromFirebase variable is always read as false in the callback function.

2.	How does your program get access to the database?

	By sending the URL when initializing the app. We had a problem with this since
	we initialized the app before creating the database, so the SDK we copied to
	the firebaseConfig did not include the databaseURL. It took us quite some time
	to realise the mistake.
